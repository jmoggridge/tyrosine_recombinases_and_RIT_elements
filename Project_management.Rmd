## Objective 1

**Create a tool to classify 'phage integrase' proteins by their catalytic domains, in line with the 20 subfamilies described by Smyshlaev *et al.* (2021).**

---

#### Datasets

- **SMART**: domain sequences and protein sequences for 20 subfamilies  

- **non-integrase**: various searches of Refseq, some Pfam families of transposases, Uniprot proteomes of yeast, arabidopsis, and human proteomes

---

#### Workflow

1.  Obtain SMART reference data for classifier    

2.  Align SMART domain sequences, build HMMs    

3.  Obtain non-integrase sequences as negative examples    

4.  Score 20 integrase HMM alignments for each sequence    

5.  Generate k-mer features    

6.  Tune & assess classifiers    

7.  Attempt stacking classifiers    

8.  *next* Apply classifier to MGE proteins and proteomes from    
assembled genomes.

#### Scripts

- `./code/tidy_smart_data.R`: reads domain and protein fasta sequences for 20 subfamilies from *./data/SMART/domain_fasta/* and */full_protein_fasta/*.
- `./code/align_smart_domains.R`: creates 20 alignments for each of the subfamilies using 'decipher'. Saves them to *./data/SMART/domain_alignments/*.
- `./code/hmms_build_and_score_SMART.txt`: bash loop to create 20 HMMs with `hmmbuild`, saved to *./data/SMART/domain_hmm/* another to get scores for all SMART full proteins against each model with `hmmsearch.` and saves to *./data/SMART/hmmsearch_res/*.
- `./code/get_refseq_non_integrases.R`: downloads non-integrases from ncbi entrez. Saves raw data for next script *.data//non_integrase_seqs/refseq_non_integrases_raw.rds*.
- `./code/tidy_non_integrases.R`: combines all non-integrase sequences in *./data/non_integrase_seqs/* and saves a fasta file for hmmsearches *./data/non_integrases.fa* and dataframe for the classifier *./data/non_integrases_df.rds*.
- `./code/score_non_integrases.txt`: bash loop to score all non-integrases against the 20 hmms. Saves results to *./non_integrase_seqs/hmmsearc_res/*
- `./code/tidy_hmmsearch_res.R`: cleans up classifier data from hmmsearch results.

## Objective 2

**Identify integrases in assembled genomes** and mobile element databases and **classify by subfamily**. For **RitA, RitB, and RitC** domains, map their genomic coordinates and check whether these constitute a **RIT element**.

#### Search MGE databases

#### Search assembled genomes

#### Search for flanking repeats

- Extract flanking genomic sequence
- Algorithm for identifying inverted repeat:
    - subsequence's reverse complement is the same as the reverse of the subsequence, for perfect base-pairing

### Other work done so far

Various scripts for obtaining & tidying mobile genetic element data to search: Iceberg, Aclame, pVOG, 

<!-- Other possible sources for MGE sequences.... PHAST (phaster), ISfinder, (others from Smyshlaev)? -->
