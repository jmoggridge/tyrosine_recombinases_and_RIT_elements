                 project include: fostering collaborative development and
                 widespread use of innovative software, reducing barriers to
                 entry into interdisciplinary scientific research, and
                 promoting the achievement of remote reproducibility of
                 research results. We describe details of our aims and methods,
                 identify current challenges, compare Bioconductor to other
                 open bioinformatics projects, and provide working examples.",
