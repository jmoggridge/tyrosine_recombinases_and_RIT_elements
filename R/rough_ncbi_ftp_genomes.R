## Try ftp for microbial genomes - use assembly fasta and gff file to locate integrases

## example
# >AAB92469.1 DNA integration/recombination/inversion protein (plasmid) [Sinorhizobium fredii NGR234]

# should be able to link from CDD -> protein -> genome -> nucleotide genbank file??




# or to use ftp
# /genomes/refseq/bacteria/Sinorhizobium_fredii/representative
